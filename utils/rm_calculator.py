    """
    Calculates 1RM and estimates rep maxes from 2RM to 10RM, optionally averaging
    with a second sample. Uses the Brzycki formula and incorporates RIR.


    Args:
    weight1: Weight lifted in the first set (lbs or kg).
    reps1: Repetitions performed in the first set.
    rir1: Reps in reserve for the first set (default: 0).
    weight2: (Optional) Weight lifted in the second set.
    reps2: (Optional) Repetitions performed in the second set.
    rir2: Reps in reserve for the second set (default: 0).


    Returns:
    A tuple containing:
    - 1RM: The calculated or averaged 1RM (float).
    - rep_max_table: A pandas DataFrame with estimated 2RM to 10RM.
